    <h1>Ayan + Naba!</h1>
    <p> Ayan had admired Naba from afar for as long as he could remember. They went to the same primary school, shared a few classes, and exchanged polite smiles now and then. But for Ayan, those little smiles meant the world. He often found himself replaying every moment they shared—a fleeting glance in the library, a quick “hello” in the hallway.

One evening, fate gave him a chance. Naba was sitting alone in the park, sketching the sunset. Gathering all his courage, Ayan walked up to her. "Mind if I sit?" he asked, his voice barely steady.

Naba looked up, surprised, but smiled and nodded. They talked about everything and nothing, from the colors of the sky to their dreams for the future. Hours passed in what felt like minutes. For the first time, Ayan felt that Naba wasn’t just the girl he admired—she was someone he connected with deeply.

Days turned into weeks, and Ayan and Naba spent more time together. They shared their secrets, fears, and hopes, growing closer with each conversation. And one rainy afternoon, as they huddled under a single umbrella, Ayan looked into her eyes and whispered, “I think I’ve been in love with you for a long time, Naba.”

Naba's cheeks flushed, and after a moment’s pause, she held his hand tightly. "I think I’ve been waiting for you to say that," she replied softly.

From that day on, Ayan and Naba were inseparable, each completing the other’s dreams, hand in hand. Their story wasn’t about grand gestures, but simple moments filled with love, laughter, and the warmth of finally being understood..</p>
