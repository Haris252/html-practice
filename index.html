    <title>Ayans love story</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Ayan + Naba!</h1>
    <p> Ayan had admired Naba from afar for as long as he could remember. They went to the same primary school, shared a few classes, and exchanged polite smiles now and then. But for Ayan, those little smiles meant the world. He often found himself replaying every moment they shared—a fleeting glance in the library, a quick “hello” in the hallway.

One evening, fate gave him a chance. Naba was sitting alone in the park, sketching the sunset. Gathering all his courage, Ayan walked up to her. "Mind if I sit?" he asked, his voice barely steady.

Naba looked up, surprised, but smiled and nodded. They talked about everything and nothing, from the colors of the sky to their dreams for the future. Hours passed in what felt like minutes. For the first time, Ayan felt that Naba wasn’t just the girl he admired—she was someone he connected with deeply.

Days turned into weeks, and Ayan and Naba spent more time together. They shared their secrets, fears, and hopes, growing closer with each conversation. And one rainy afternoon, as they huddled under a single umbrella, Ayan looked into her eyes and whispered, “I think I’ve been in love with you for a long time, Naba.”

Naba's cheeks flushed, and after a moment’s pause, she held his hand tightly. "I think I’ve been waiting for you to say that," she replied softly.

From that day on, Ayan and Naba were inseparable, each completing the other’s dreams, hand in hand. Their story wasn’t about grand gestures, but simple moments filled with love, laughter, and the warmth of finally being understood
      
      
      
      
      
After Ayan and Naba's beautiful wedding, they began a new chapter in their lives. Ayan was a successful businessman, and his wealth meant they could live comfortably. He loved spoiling Naba and fulfilling her every wish, trusting her deeply. They lived in a grand mansion, and Ayan often spent his days working while Naba managed the house.

Over time, Naba began to show a different side to herself. She discovered a secret stash of money Ayan kept in the house—a sum that totaled ten crore rupees. Tempted by the thought of it, Naba started taking a little at a time, using it to indulge in her cravings and buy endless amounts of food and luxurious treats. She would tell herself it was just a small expense, that Ayan would never notice. But as her indulgence grew, so did the amounts she stole—and the toll it took on her.

As weeks went by, Ayan noticed that Naba was spending less time with him and more time in her private space, where she would order lavish meals and hide the receipts. She grew more distant, and Ayan chalked it up to their busy lives, unaware of her growing secret. Her indulgence began to show as she gained weight, yet he never questioned her, thinking she might simply be adjusting to the comforts of their life together.

Months later, Ayan's accountant noticed discrepancies in his accounts and informed him. Curious, Ayan started to investigate and realized that his secret stash had dwindled to almost nothing. Confused and hurt, he decided to confront Naba gently, hoping there was a simple explanation.

When he approached her about it, Naba broke down, confessing how she had been unable to control her temptations and how her actions had spiraled beyond what she’d ever intended. She admitted to using the money to satisfy her cravings and was deeply ashamed. She realized that, in the process, she had risked the most precious thing in her life: Ayan’s trust.

Ayan was heartbroken but, after some time, saw the pain in her remorse. He forgave her, and together, they worked to rebuild their trust, with Naba learning to cherish what truly mattered. In the end, their love endured not just the good times, but the difficult ones as well, reminding them both that trust and forgiveness were the real riches of their relationship..</p>
